# Notes
I've become increasingly frustrated by my ability to record my notes in a searchable fashion.
This is a basic CRUD API for storing my notes in a way that I will like, and can programatically iterate on.
Goodbye Apple Notes. You served your purpose well.

## Usage
```
# Run the application
`cargo run`
```
